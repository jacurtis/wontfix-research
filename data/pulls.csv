When I work with https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/pull/4401 and do some research and test, I found problem when I create JsonObject and JsonArray with `ImmutableCollections`.

Take  the below example:

```
  @Test
  void testMapOf(Vertx vertx, VertxTestContext testContext) {
    Map<String, Object> map = Map.of(""x"", 1);
    JsonObject obj = new JsonObject(map);
    logger.info(""Run testMapOf with JsonObject "" + obj);

    try {
      obj.put(""y"", ""222"");
      testContext.failNow(""Should not reach here"");
      return;
    } catch (Throwable t) {
      logger.info(""Run testMapOf with JsonObject updating error"" + t);
    }

    testContext.completeNow();
  }
```

When I create JsonObject with a map created by Map.of, a immutable map, the JsonObject instance I created cannot updated again, this feels strange.

To mitigate this danger, I have been using a naming convention for such unused parameters, but I think a better solution is to allow passing a nullary `Supplier` function instead:

```java
f.compose(() -> returnAnotherFuture());

This changeset adds support for that syntax, and similarly for `Future::eventually` (which has the same problem).

Previously the capacity of the queue was Integer.MAX_VALUE (unbounded)

are processing more requests than they can handle.

For instance, as work tasks begin to queue for the workerPool, clients
that have yet to be serviced start retrying their operations. The queue
then continues to grow with clients continuing to retry their operation.

Motivation:

Provide a generic way to serialize POJOs without the need to implement your own.

Support must be enabled to use the generic codec.
E.g.
```java
EventBus eventBus = vertx.eventBus().enableGenericCodec();
POJO ping = new POJO(""Ping..."");

eventBus.<POJO>consumer(ADDRESS, message -> {
  POJO pong = new POJO(""Pong..."");
  message.reply(pong);

eventBus.<POJO>request(ADDRESS, ping, reply -> {
  POJO pong = reply.result().body();

For instance, as work tasks begin to queue for the workerPool, clients

then continues to grow with clients continuing to retry their operation.

When I work with https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/pull/4401 and do some research and test, I found problem when I create JsonObject and JsonArray with `ImmutableCollections`.

Take  the below example:

```
  @Test
  void testMapOf(Vertx vertx, VertxTestContext testContext) {
    Map<String, Object> map = Map.of(""x"", 1);
    JsonObject obj = new JsonObject(map);
    logger.info(""Run testMapOf with JsonObject "" + obj);

    try {
      obj.put(""y"", ""222"");
      testContext.failNow(""Should not reach here"");
      return;
    } catch (Throwable t) {
      logger.info(""Run testMapOf with JsonObject updating error"" + t);
    }

    testContext.completeNow();
  }
```

When I create JsonObject with a map created by Map.of, a immutable map, the JsonObject instance I created cannot updated again, this feels strange.

This pull request is a draft and look forward to further discussion for a correct solution if this is a problem, and I will make a reasonable change after that.
If this is expected, I will close it.",liuchong,236058

```java
Future<Void> f = returnSomeVoidFuture();

The problem here is that when the unary `Function` argument is invoked, `unused` has the value `null`, so programmers must be careful not to reference it. To mitigate this danger, I have been using a naming convention for such unused parameters, but I think a better solution is to allow passing a nullary `Supplier` function instead:

```java
f.compose(() -> returnAnotherFuture());
```

This changeset adds support for that syntax, and similarly for `Future::eventually` (which has the same problem).

P.S. I think it would be nice if `Future::onComplete` and `Future::onSuccess` also supported this syntax, but that change seems much more difficult to implement in a backwards-compatible way.",markmatney,6744471
